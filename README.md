# Intensity Analysis (Emotion Classification)

## Overview
This project focuses on **Emotion Classification** using data analysis and machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to analyze and classify text data based on emotional intensity, providing insights into the underlying emotions.

## Key Features
- Preprocessing of text data, including handling special characters, stopwords, and tokenization.
- Visualization of data distributions and trends using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
- Implementation of emotion classification models.

## Tools and Libraries
The following tools and libraries are used in this project:

- **Python Libraries**:
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation.
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly` for data visualization.
  - `re` and `string` for text preprocessing.
  - `collections` for advanced data manipulation.
- **Google Colab**: For running the notebook efficiently with cloud-based resources.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading**:
   - Accessing datasets from Google Drive.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning and standardizing text data.
   - Handling missing values and noise.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizing patterns, distributions, and relationships in the data.
4. **Emotion Classification**:
   - Building and evaluating models to classify text based on emotional intensity.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/emotion-intensity-analysis.git
   ```
2. Open the notebook file (`Intensity_Analysis_RashmiRanjan.ipynb`) in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to load data, preprocess, and run the analysis.

## Results
The project includes various visualizations and metrics to illustrate the performance of the emotion classification models. Insights and key findings are documented in the notebook.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

Required Python packages can be installed using:
```bash
