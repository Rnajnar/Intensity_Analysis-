Intensity Analysis (Emotion Classification)

Overview

This project focuses on Emotion Classification using data analysis and machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to analyze and classify text data based on emotional intensity, providing insights into the underlying emotions.

Key Features

Preprocessing of text data, including handling special characters, stopwords, and tokenization.

Visualization of data distributions and trends using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

Implementation of emotion classification models.

Tools and Libraries

The following tools and libraries are used in this project:

Python Libraries:

pandas and numpy for data manipulation.

matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly for data visualization.

re and string for text preprocessing.

collections for advanced data manipulation.

Google Colab: For running the notebook efficiently with cloud-based resources.

Project Workflow

Data Loading:

Accessing datasets from Google Drive.

Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning and standardizing text data.

Handling missing values and noise.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizing patterns, distributions, and relationships in the data.

Emotion Classification:

Building and evaluating models to classify text based on emotional intensity.

How to Use

Clone the repository to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/your-username/emotion-intensity-analysis.git

Open the notebook file (Intensity_Analysis_RashmiRanjan.ipynb) in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
